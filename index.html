  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <p>A millenial South African, living in the UK and dreaming about having pets and an interesting career with opportunties to learn constantly</p>
  <p>I got into coding because I've always been really curious about it, but intimidated because it felt like a very exclusionary 'male' field and you had to be really smart to do it as a career. Luckily I got over my imposter syndrome and joined Manchester Codes to start my journey as a junior developer!</p>
